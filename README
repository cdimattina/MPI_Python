README for MPI_Python repository

Description: A set of simple programs that illustate the power of parallel computing with MPI.
Running the code in this repository requires MPI for python installed in your Python environment.
To run any MPI program "this_program.py" from the command line, type

[user@computer]$ mpirun -n <# processors> python this_program.py <arg1> .... <argn>

where <# processors> is the number of processors (1,2,3...) and <arg1> ... <argn> are the
input arguments to this_program.py

MPI Programs in ./FIBO 

get_size.py             : Gets the size of the global communicator
comm.py                 : Gets the rank of each node
bcast1.py               : Broadcasts data from the manager node to the worker nodes
scat1.py                : Managr scatters fibonacci tasks to worker nodes + then collects results
ptp.py                  : Manager node 0 moves information to worker node 1
fibomodmpi.py           : Takes as inputs 4 numbers, each of 4 worker nodes computes 1 fibonacci number

MPI Programs in ./SUM

parallel_add_numbers.py : Adds up numbers 1 to 100 using parallelization
