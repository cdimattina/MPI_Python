README for MPI_Python repository

Description: A set of simple programs that illustate the power of parallel computing with MPI.
Running the code in this repository requires MPI for python installed in your Python environment.
To run any MPI program "this_program.py" from the command line, type

[user@computer]$ mpirun -n <# processors> python this_program.py <arg1> .... <argn>

where <# processors> is the number of processors (1,2,3...) and <arg1> ... <argn> are the
input arguments to this_program.py

MPI Programs in ./FIBO

get_size.py   : Gets the size of the global communicator
comm.py       : Gets the rank of each node

Other Programs in ./FIBO
